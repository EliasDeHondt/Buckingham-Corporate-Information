                    <p class="article-section-text">IT equipment must be disposed of via a University approved disposal contractor, who will physically destroy all storage media and recycle everything else.</p>
                    <p class="article-section-text">Every computer or device comes to the end of its life at the University and is disposed of. There may be liabilities associated with the subsequent use of the equipment, and such systems may store information that is confidential; thus care has to be taken over their disposal.</p>
                    <p class="article-section-text">When disposing of IT equipment, where information and data are stored. In particular, if any personal or other confidential data may be present, then special care must be taken to ensure that this information is removed such that it cannot be accessed by anyone.</p>
                    <p class="article-section-text">There have been high profile cases where this care has not been adequately exercised; the Data Protection Act 1998 requires us to take these issues very seriously. It is also necessary to ensure any software licensed to the University is removed.</p>
                    <p class="article-section-text">If you have such equipment please return it to the University IT Services Department. Contact IT Services for specific location and drop-off instructions.</p>
