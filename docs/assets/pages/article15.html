                    <p class="article-section-text">It is an offence for a person to […] distribute or show such indecent photographs or to possess such indecent photographs, with a view to their being distributed or shown by himself or others.</p>
                    <p class="article-section-text">Section 160 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 made the simple possession of indecent photographs of children an offence. Making an indecent image of a child is a serious arrestable offence carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment. The term "make" includes downloading images from the Internet and storing or printing them out.</p>
