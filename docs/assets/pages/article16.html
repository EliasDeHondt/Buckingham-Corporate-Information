                    <p class="article-section-text">The Laptop Loan Scheme is in place to offer the loan of University equipment to students to enable them to study online, where they may be unable to access this equipment otherwise due to financial hardship, digital exclusion, or other extenuating circumstances.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="article-section" id="eligibility">
                    <h2 class="article-section-title">Eligibility</h2>
                    <ul class="article-section-list">
                        <li class="article-section-list-item">Eligibility will be assessed, and equipment will be provided once students have registered on their course for the Academic year. Online registration must be complete before equipment loan can be issued.</li>
                        <li class="article-section-list-item">Eligibility will be assessed by the Student Services team and additional evidence may be sought from the student to confirm their circumstances.</li>
                        <li class="article-section-list-item">Eligible applicants will be passed to the University IT Services team who will allocate an appropriate loan equipment.</li>
                        <li class="article-section-list-item">Eligible applicants who take custody of an equipment understand that if the equipment is lost, stolen or damaged whilst in their care, they may be liable to pay repair/replacement costs up to £200. (The University of Buckingham recommends that students add the equipment to their home insurance if possible to cover for any loss or damage. It may be possible for this to be covered by parental home insurance – please take guidance from the appropriate insurance company)</li>
                        <li class="article-section-list-item">Students will be required to acknowledge these Terms & Conditions before the issuing of any IT equipment.</li>
                        <li class="article-section-list-item">The loan scheme is only open to a student who is in session, and who has a 'UK' fee status.</li>

                        <li class="article-section-list-item">Applicants will need to complete the discretionary funding online application in order to be considered, which will be available in the student portal.</li>
                        <li class="article-section-list-item">There is a limited budget for the supply of equipment, so eligibility does not guarantee that students will receive an equipment although every effort will be made to support students in some capacity.</li>
                        <li class="article-section-list-item">Applications will remain open until available equipment have been exhausted.</li>
                        <li class="article-section-list-item">At the time of an equipment being provided to you, the University will add £200 to your student account and you authorise the University to take payment from you for any loss or damage of the equipment.</li>
                        <li class="article-section-list-item">If an equipment is returned in satisfactory condition then this deposit will be cleared from the account balance.</li>

                        <li class="article-section-list-item">Eligible students will be provided with an email confirmation which will enable them to receive a University loan equipment from IT dedicated collection location.</li>
                        <li class="article-section-list-item">The specification of the loan equipment provided will be a standard University specification and determined to be appropriate for the large majority of student needs. Remote desktop solutions will enable students to harness additional computing resources.</li>
                        <li class="article-section-list-item">The student may keep the loaned equipment for the duration of their studies and will be expected to return this to the University on withdrawal or completion of their course, or where the loan is otherwise no longer required (whichever comes first).</li>

                        <li class="article-section-list-item">Students who defer their place after eligibility is confirmed will not be issued with an equipment until they return to their studies and register for their course.</li>
                        <li class="article-section-list-item">Successful applicants will be required to ‘fully register’ onto their course to remain eligible for the loaned equipment. This entails completing the online registration form and providing original evidence of their personal identity within the first week of the start date of the course and paying the residual balance of any fees.

                        <li class="article-section-list-item">Students who suspend their studies will be expected to return their loan equipment as per the returns process. The option to reapply will be provided when the student returns to their studies should they still require the equipment.</li>
