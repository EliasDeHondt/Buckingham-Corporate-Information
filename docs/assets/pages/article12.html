                    <p class="article-section-text">We live in an information age. It is easy to access vast amounts of information. Achieving confidence in the reliability, authenticity, integrity and security of that information is more difficult.</p>
                    <p class="article-section-text">As a University, the University of Buckingham recognises that quality assured information is a key asset. Our information is used throughout all of our academic and administrative activities and is central to our core purpose of advancing education and research for the benefit of society.</p>

                    <h3 class="article-section-subtitle">Information is an Asset</h3>
                    <p class="article-section-text">It is fundamental to the efficient and effective operation of all University activity, is recognised as a valuable resource and is managed as such.</p>
                    <h3 class="article-section-subtitle">Information is Available</h3>
                    <p class="article-section-text">It is available to all members of the University for as long as it is required, unless there is a valid reason why it cannot be shared.</p>
                    <h3 class="article-section-subtitle">Information is Secured</h3>
                    <p class="article-section-text">It is managed and safeguarded from unauthorized access, whether intentional or unintentional.</p>
                    <h3 class="article-section-subtitle">Information is Compliant</h3>
                    <p class="article-section-text">It is managed ethically, and according to the relevant legal and regulatory frameworks, including those protecting individuals' rights.</p>
                    <h3 class="article-section-subtitle">Information is Fit for Purpose</h3>
                    <p class="article-section-text">It is managed to make sure it is accurate and complete in a form that meets the business needs of those using it.</p>
